Features Of Grocery Buddy:
Allows users to open the App   
The main page will show a hamburger menu on the top left side 
The App's main page is used to show the location on the map, and the "locate me" button 
A button that says, "locate me" is created. When tapped the user's location is detected and shown on the map.
Once the end-user taps on the "locate me" button, almost instantly, the map will show nearby grocery stores .
End-users can also tap on the hamburger menu on the top left and go to "menu page"  
End-users can select the "Profile" option from the "Menu Page" and update their profile with: 
First Name 
Last Name 
Profile picture (From both front and back camera)  
End-users can also select the "order my groceries" option from the "Menu Page" that shows the user a list of basic groceries (e.g., Milk, Egg, Bread, Banana, Cheese, Yogurt)
End-users can select the "Payment" option from the "Menu Page" and fill out payment details
After selecting a  grocery item (as this is a simple app,  we will need to choose only one grocery item from the basic groceries), the end-user is taken to the "Delivery Details" page
The "Delivery Details" page shows the delivery cost based on the distance between the current location and the selected grocery store. 
Important Note: All the data collected by this App will be only saved on the phone's database. There is no back-end or server-side database for data storage.
